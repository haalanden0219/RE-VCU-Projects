# RE-VCU-Projects
As I complete tasks/assignments I will add them to the repo as well as any sort of documentation or write up that may be applicable. I will **NOT** be posting my solution in the README of the respository. My solutions can seen in any of the PDF or MD files I uploaded corresponding to the challenge. Below I tried to give some background on the challenge without spoiling the solution incase anyone wants to try the challenge for themselves. I recommended doing all challenges in a virtual machine.

## Assignment 1
- This was a basic challenge that focused on understanding how assemblers work.
- We were tasked to compile a .asm file in 32-bit and 64-bit format.
- My Solution can be seen which shows my thinking and how what I learned.
  
## Assignment 2
- This was the first challenge that involved us diassembling a program.
- We were given an ELF file to exam that included Debug symbols. We were NOT allowed to use a decompiler.
- I used GDB to perform my debugging.
- When I compared my solution to my peers I realized that there is a lot more information you can get when debug symbols are allowed.
- My solution can be seen in the corresponding file to this challenge.

## Assignment 3
- This was a more in depth .ELF challenge. There were no debug symbols and the use of a decompiler was not allowed.
- I used GDB to perform my debugging.
- My solution can be seen in a proper report which was written as if I was reporting to a head of a company and a technical team. This includes a technical explanation and non-technical explanation.
- I have rough notes as well that includes all the pitfalls I encountered as well as what lead to my solution.
- This challenge really forced me to read up and understand more about assembly code. Not being able to use a decompiler made it harder but it made me realize that I was relying on them a little too much.

## Assignment 4
- This was a basic windows challenge where the goal was to understand the differences between .ELF and .EXE files. The use of decompilers was allowed for this challenge.
- You can see my notes in PDF I upload corresponding to this assignment.
- I have done previous work on windows executables so I was familar with what the challenge wanted to teach.

## Assignment 5 ("final" software challenge)
- This was a more advanced windows challenge that involved an encrypted password.
- This acted as the final challenge for the class.
- I upload some code that pertained to this challenge specifically.

## Assignment 6 (advanced software challenge)
- This was a similar executable to that of Assignment 5. The main difference was the password was generated more dynamically.
- This challenge had some code that went along with it. (run.py & password_cracker.c)
- This challenge was given to me after the class for me to do on my own time.
- The write up is much shorter since I was focusing on the dynamic password generation and trying to not rehash the executable information from assignment 5.
